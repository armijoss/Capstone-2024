## Research Question
 This study delves into the influence of CEO prior work experience on internal labor markets and turnover rates within professional services firms, focusing on Deloitte and Ernst & Young (EY) as case studies. 

## Motivation
 Several articles have pointed out the challenges faced by the accounting profession in hiring new auditors. This can be attributed to generational shifts, diminished excitement surrounding the job tasks, and comparatively lower wages. An underexplored explanation revolves around the evolving backgrounds of CEOs leading accounting firms, transitioning from auditing to consulting roles as the Big 4 firms expand their consulting divisions. This shift in CEO experience potentially shapes employee allocation strategies concerning promotions, departures, and other aspects. Given the CEO's prior work experience, does it determine their emphasis on specific areas within the firm? In simpler terms, does a CEO's previous tenure in the consulting arm correlate with reduced resource allocation towards auditing, possibly hindering recruitment efforts or providing lesser incentives for employee retention, consequently leading to increased turnover? This study aims to examine whether a CEO's background influences organizational operations and if it contributes to heightened turnover rates in certain segments of the business.

## Importance
 Understanding the impact of CEOs' prior work experience can affect the organizational dynamics within firms and this is crucial for a few reasons. Firstly, it sheds light on the mechanisms in place to understand workforce allocation and resource distribution. These are both fundamental aspects of organizational efficiency and effectiveness. By uncovering preferences stemming from CEO backgrounds, firms can ensure treatment of different business segments is equal. Secondly, the study investigates a pressing issue in the accounting profession: the challenge of hiring and retaining talent, particularly in auditing roles. This analysis can identify factors contributing to higher turnover costs in non-related segments; which offers valuable insights for firms grappling with recruitment difficulties and seeking to enhance employee retention strategies. Moreover, as accounting firms evolve, understanding how CEO backgrounds shape their decisions can help firms stay competitive. Ultimately, by exploring the relationship between CEO backgrounds and organizational outcomes, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of managerial influences within professional services firms, paving the way for more informed practices and improved performance outcomes

## Summary of Work
 This study utilized employment history data from individuals previously employed by Deloitte or EY to examine the relationship between CEO backgrounds and employee dynamics within these firms. The dataset encompassed various attributes including job roles, tenure lengths, and employment focuses. Data cleaning and preprocessing involved classifying records into auditing, consulting, or other categories based on occupation codes. Years of experience in auditing or consulting were calculated for each individual, with missing end dates filled to ensure accuracy. Extreme values were addressed through inference and removal of problematic records. The methodology included classification of records, exit analysis to identify individuals leaving the firm, and analysis of lateral, promotion, and demotion movements within the organization. Data frames were merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. 
Regression analysis was conducted to explore factors influencing employee transitions, including exit, promotion, demotion, and lateral moves.

## Results
 The regression analysis revealed significant correlations between the shared_focus variable and various dependent variables for both Deloitte and EY. Notably, shared focus emerged as a pivotal indicator of alignment between CEOs and employees in either auditing or consulting within these firms. In the regression analysis for Deloitte, the shared_focus variable showed statistical significance in several dependent variables: lateral movements, promotions, demotions, and lateral movements within the organization. This indicates a correlation between CEO shared focus and the probability of experiencing these dependent variables. Notably, all coefficients were negative, suggesting that an increase in shared focus is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of experiencing these variables. For EY, statistical significance was observed solely for the promotion variable when examining the shared_focus variable in the regression analysis. This implies a correlation between the CEO's shared focus and the likelihood of promotions within EY. The positive coefficient indicates that an increase in shared focus corresponds to an increase in the likelihood of promotions within the organization. Other dependent variables, such as exit, demotion, and lateral movements within the organization, did not show statistical significance for EY.

## Challenges 

## Next Steps
 Moving ahead, we have several paths to consider. Firstly, expanding our analysis to include more accounting firms could offer a comprehensive understanding of how CEO backgrounds influence organizational dynamics within the industry. This approach may uncover consistent patterns across the dependent variables. Additionally, integrating qualitative research methods, such as interviews or surveys with employees and executives, could provide deeper insights into the subjective experiences and perceptions that drive workforce allocation strategies and retention efforts within these firms. By pursuing these next steps, we have the opportunity to not only enhance our understanding of the impact of CEO backgrounds on organizational operations but also to develop evidence-based strategies.

## Reproducibility
 Reproducing the work is not doable. Three data set files couldn't be uploaded successfully, including "Sam_Deloitte_Sample" and "Sam_EY_Sample," which are essential for the initial classification step. Despite attempting to compress them into a zip file, their size remained too large for upload. This issue disrupts the flow of the subsequent steps in the notebooks. Some files in the Data folder needed to be zipped before being uploaded. Instead of attempting to replicate, it's more practical to follow the existing work. The notebooks are clearly labeled with steps, so one can start with any firm's analysis. Each notebook indicates where to begin, and they are well-documented to facilitate understanding of the thought processes and steps involved. Google Colab was utilized for this project.
