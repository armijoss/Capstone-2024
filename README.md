## Research Question
This study delves into the influence of CEO prior work experience on internal labor markets and turnover rates within professional services firms, focusing on Deloitte and Ernst & Young (EY) as case studies. 

## Motivation
Many articles have pointed out that the accounting profession has had a difficult time hiring new auditors. This has been attributed to generational shifts, lack of excitement around job tasks, and lower relative wages. One unexplored explanation is that the experience of the CEOs who head accounting firms has changed from auditing to consulting as the Big 4 accounting firms have grown their consulting arms. Given their prior experience, does that dictate what area they emphasize and are there signs of inefficiency? In other words, does having a CEO who previously worked in the consulting arm of the firm imply that they direct fewer resources toward the auditing arm and either: 1) prevent them from hiring in that segment or 2) provide fewer incentives for employees to stay (which will increase turnover)?

- talk about using google colab
 -Missing 3 datasets: 
   a. Sam_Deloitte_Sample - the original df used for analysis
  b. Sam_EY_Sample - the original df used for analysis

  - Even after compressing the files they were still too large to be uploaded
 - talk abt some files uploaded had to be zipped to upload.
